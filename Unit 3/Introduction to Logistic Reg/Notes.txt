1. Logistic Regression: Extension of linear regression. 
   Formula: 1/(1+exp(-1*(b0+b1x1+b2x2...bkxk)))
2. Logistic Function lies between 0 and 1 and represents probability
3. Odds = P(y=1)/P(y=0)
4. Odds = exp(b0+b1x1+b2x2..bkxk)
   log(Odds) = Linear regression formula
   Logit: Looks like linear regression formula
5. Ans1: exp(-1.5+3-2.5) = logit
         exp(-1)
6 caTools: A package in R which is used for randomly splitting the data
  to training set and testing set
7. Lower the AIC in our model, better the model
8. Since Logistic Regression gives the probabilty, we define a threshold
   value for 0 or 1
9. We find the confusion matrix to understand which model to pick
10. We need to maximise True Negatives and True Positives while minimise
   the False Negatives and False Positives
11. Sensitivity = TP/(TP+FN)
    Specificity = TN/(TN+FP)
12. To find the best threshold value, we draw the ROC curve to find the 
    place where these values coincide
13. ROCR is a package used to find the ROC curve
14. AUC AREA UNDER ROC CURVE gives the quality of prediction
15. More AUC is desirable.. if AUC is less than 0.5 then it is pure 
    guessing
16. Overall Error rate = (FP+FN)/N
    Overall Accuracy = (TN+TP)/N
