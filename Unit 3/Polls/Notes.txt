1. Deal with missing data:
	i) Delete obs
	ii) Remove the entire variables completely
	iii) Fill with average values
	iv) Fill wrt one variable, for eg if one var is small, predict the other
	    to be large
2. Mice package is used for filling in the NA values
3. To use a package, library('package_name')
4. first make a subset of those values which have an implication of the NA variab
-les. Then make those variables go with this command:
imputed = complete(mice(simple)) in order to make those NA values fill themselves
5. Smaller the AIC better the model
6. Changing the Cutoff makes sense only when we need to correctly predict values
   which are more than 2 in number. In this case, since we can only have the 
   answer as Republican(1) or Democrat(0) it really does not matter
