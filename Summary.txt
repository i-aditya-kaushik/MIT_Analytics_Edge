Linear Regression:
    Used for:
        Predicting a continuous outcome(salary, price,number of votes,etc)
    Pros: 
        Simple, well recognized, works on small and large datasets
    Cons: 
        Assumes a Linear relationship (y= a*log(x)+b)

Logistic Regression:
    Used for:
        Predicting a categorical outcome((Yes/No),(Sell/Buy),(Accept/Reject))
    Pros:
        Computes probabilities that can be used to access confidence of the 
        Prediction
    Cons:
        Assumes a Linear relationship

CART:
    Used for:
        Predicting a categorical outcome(quality rating 1-5, Buy/Sell/Hold) or a
        continuous outcome.
    Pros:
        Can handle datasets without a Linear relationship. Easy to interpret
    Cons:
        May not work well with small datasets

Random Forests:
    Used for:
        Same as CART
    Pros:
        Can improve accuracy as compared to CART
    Cons:
        Many parameters to adjust
        Not as easy to explain

Hierarchical Clustering:
    Used for:
        Finding Similar Groups
        Clustering into smaller Groups and applying predictive methods on Groups

    Pros:
        No need to select number of clusters a priori
        Visualize with a dendogram to analyse the number of clusters
    Cons:
        Hard to use with large datasets

K means:
    Used for:
        Same as Hierarchical Clustering
    Pros:
        Works with complex dataset size
    Cons:
        Need to select number of clusters before algo
