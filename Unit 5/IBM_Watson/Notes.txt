Step 1:
    LATs are used to generate answers. For eg, This singer is the world's best singer.
    Here LAT is going to be This singer.

Step 2:
    The second step is Hypothesis generation. Here we look at the candidate answers.
    For eg, This planet is hottest in solar system will have candidate answers like 
    Earth, Mercury,Mars, etc

    Hypothesis 1: Mars is hottest in solar system.
    Hypothesis 2: Earth is hottest in solar system
    Hypothesis 3....

Step 3:
    Lightweight Scoring Algo:
        If likelihood is not high, it discards if the likelihood is good enough, then it keeps it for
        the next Step
    Passage Search:
        It searches for the evidence in the passages of its database and comes up with the best 
        Hypothesis
    Scoring Analytics is performed

Step 4:
    Final Merging and ranking. For eg, the similar things like Obama and first black president should be 
    merged and the results for them should be added. 
    Then we rank the Hypothesis and come up with the best answer
    Logistic Regression is used for Scoring Algo.. if the confidence is good enough, then it buzzes for 
    the  answers
