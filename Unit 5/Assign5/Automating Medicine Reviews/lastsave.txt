[1] "Zoledronic acid has direct and indirect antitumor effects. However, the optimal regimen for breast cancer patients remains to be determined. This study aimed to compare biomarker changes between a weekly low dose (metronomic arm) and a conventional dosage of zoledronic acid (conventional arm), and to explore correlations between biomarkers and progression-free survival (PFS). Sixty breast cancer patients with bone metastases were randomized to receive either zoledronic acid 1 mg IV weekly for 4 doses or a single dose of zoledronic acid 4 mg IV. Administration of other treatments was delayed for 1 month. Serial blood samples were collected on days 1, 15, 29, and at 3 months. Serum VEGF alteration was the primary endpoint. Compared to the conventional arm, the metronomic arm resulted in a significantly greater reduction in serum levels of VEGF and N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) over time during the first month of treatment. Serum CA 15-3 level stabilized over time in the metronomic arm, but increased in the conventional arm. Independent prognostic factors for PFS included chemotherapy received (HR, 8.042; P = 0.000), estrogen receptor status (HR, 2.837; P = 0.020), VEGF levels at 3 months after intervention (HR, 2.026; P = 0.045), and baseline NTx (HR, 1.051; P = 0.001). Metronomic low-dose zoledronic acid is more effective than the conventional regimen and generates sustained reductions in circulating VEGF and NTx levels, as well as stabilization of serum CA 15-3 levels (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00524849)."
