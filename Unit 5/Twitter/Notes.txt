Sentiment Analysis:
    Natural Language Processing.
    Bag of Words:
        Each word is taken as an independent variable and a score is assigned to each of the word.
        If we preprocess the txt, we get better results. For preprocessing,
            1.First, we need to Clean irregularities by converting everything into the same case.
            2.Remove Punctuation to preprocess
            3.Remove unhelpful terms: like the, who, that.. sometimes not helpful
            4.Porter Stemming: Remove the past tense,past perfect, etc from the words. eg: joke joked joking are considered as the root
            word, hence all are counted as joke.
    For preprocessing, we download 2 packages, namely tm and SnowballC(This helps us to extract tm package)
    Tm converts the tweets into corpus.
    The command has been defined in R files. The tm_map is used as to convert into one case

    In R, we implement bag of words by applying DocumentTermMatrix on the preprocessed corpus
    For finding the most frequent word, we use findFreqTerms function
    When we build a randomForest model for Analysis of sentiment, it takes longer time due to the fact that we address more number of independent variables 
    when it comes to this.
