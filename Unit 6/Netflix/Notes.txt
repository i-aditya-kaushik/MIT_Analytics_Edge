Recommendation Systems:
    Collaborative Filtering: Seeing the similarities between the two users and coming up with an answer
    Content Filtering: Based on actors, directors, etc

Distance in Clustering:
    Find the Distance:
        By Eucledian Distance
        By Manhattan Distance
    Minimum Distance between the Clusters
    Maximum Distance between the Clusters
    Most popular:
        Centroid Distance
    One needs to normalize data since the difference can be in terms of 1000s for one variable and 10s for others
    So we find the mean and divide it by deviation to get the results

Hirarchical Clustering:
    Converts two clusters with minimum Eucledian Distance and Converts them into clusters
    See the cluster dendogram and accordingly decide the number of clusters
    read.table('movieLens.txt',header = FALSE,sep ='|',quote="\"")
    The above command is used to read into a txt file with a separator of | in between. The quote function makes sure
    that the data is read properly
