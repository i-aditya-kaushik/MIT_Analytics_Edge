Clustering the grayscaled images is a way to cluster colors

We convert the image into a matrix first as it is important 
and then as a vector otherwise our data wont be changed and 
the individual variables will be converted to a vector, which 
is not required

In order to use one image as training set and other as testing set
we need flexclust

kcca = k centroid cluster analysis
